## Key Business Questions & Answers

##**QUESTIONS**
What are the major trends in freight value and volume?
How do different modes compare in terms of cost-efficiency and environmental sustainability?
What are the key seasonal patterns and their implications?
Which trade corridors show the highest growth and value?
What are the safety risks and environmental impacts across transport modes?
How is the modal split evolving and what are the infrastructure implications?
What strategic recommendations can be made for improvement?

### Q1: Major Trends in Freight Value and Volume
- Vessel transport dominates with 65.0% of total freight value
- Mail services handle 12.9% of value
- Rail contributes 7.5% of total value
- Heavy reliance on maritime transport for international freight

### Q2: Cost-Efficiency and Environmental Sustainability
- Most cost-efficient: Road ($1,123.06/ton) and Rail ($83.06/ton)
- Most environmentally sustainable: Pipeline (0.01 kg CO2/ton) and Rail (0.02 kg CO2/ton)
- Rail offers the best balance of cost efficiency and environmental sustainability

### Q3: Seasonal Patterns and Implications
- Peak activity occurs in May
- Suggests potential capacity constraints during peak periods
- Infrastructure planning should account for seasonal variations

### Q4: High-Growth Trade Corridors
Top trade corridors by value:
- Texas: $911.3B
- Michigan: $440.5B
- California: $315.2B
These corridors should be prioritized for infrastructure investment

### Q5: Safety Risks and Environmental Impacts
Environmental Impact Rankings (kg CO2 per ton):
- Air: 1.53
- Road/Mail: 0.16
- Rail: 0.02
- Pipeline: 0.01

### Q6: Modal Split Evolution and Infrastructure Implications
Current modal split suggests:
- Heavy reliance on maritime infrastructure
- Need for better intermodal connections
- Potential capacity constraints in major ports

### Q7: Strategic Recommendations
1. Invest in port infrastructure to support dominant vessel traffic
2. Develop intermodal connections for efficient transfers
3. Implement emission reduction strategies for high-impact modes
4. Optimize capacity utilization during peak seasons
5. Focus on rail infrastructure for sustainable growth
