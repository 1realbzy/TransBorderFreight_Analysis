# Week 2 Progress: Analyzing TransBorder Freight Data with Python

This week, I made significant progress in my TransBorder Freight Data Analysis project, focusing on uncovering freight movement patterns across North America. Here's a detailed breakdown of what I accomplished:

## 1. Data Infrastructure Setup

I started by creating a robust data processing pipeline that can handle the complex structure of TransBorder freight data. Key components include:

- **Data Loader Module**: Implemented a flexible data loader that handles different file encodings and data types
- **Inspection Tools**: Created utilities to understand data structure and validate our assumptions
- **Analysis Framework**: Set up a modular analysis framework that separates concerns and promotes code reusability

## 2. Initial Pattern Analysis

The first phase of analysis focused on understanding basic freight movement patterns:

### Transportation Modes Analysis
- Analyzed distribution of different transportation modes (Truck, Rail, Air, Vessel, etc.)
- Created visualizations comparing value vs. weight percentages for each mode
- Identified dominant transportation methods in the North American freight system

### Regional Pattern Analysis
- Mapped trade relationships between US states and international partners
- Identified top trading states and provinces
- Created interactive visualizations using Plotly for better data exploration

## 3. Detailed Pattern Analysis

I then dove deeper into specific aspects of the freight movement:

### Seasonal Patterns
- Analyzed monthly variations in freight movement
- Created time series visualizations to identify seasonal trends
- Tracked both shipment values and volumes over time

### Trade Corridors
- Identified major origin-destination pairs
- Analyzed the busiest trade routes
- Created visualizations to highlight key trade corridors

### Commodity Analysis
- Started work on analyzing commodity distribution
- Created treemap visualizations to show relative importance of different commodity types

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

During this week, I encountered and solved several technical challenges:

1. **Data Encoding**: Handled various file encodings (UTF-8, Latin1) to ensure proper data reading
2. **Memory Management**: Implemented chunk processing to handle large datasets efficiently
3. **Data Quality**: Created robust error handling to deal with missing or inconsistent data

## Next Steps

For the coming week, I plan to:

1. Complete the commodity distribution analysis
2. Extend the analysis to cover 2021 and 2022 data
3. Begin work on identifying operational inefficiencies
4. Implement automated testing for our analysis pipeline

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python for data processing and analysis
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Git for version control and collaboration

This project is teaching me valuable lessons about handling real-world data and creating scalable data analysis solutions. Stay tuned for more updates!
